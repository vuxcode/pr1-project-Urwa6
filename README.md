# Project Summary

> I wanted to make Word-Guess Game by using only what we have learned in this course so far. A simple Word-Guess game with three categories 
and user can choose which option they want to guess.  
In a start it felt like it would be so easy to make a program but it really needed full attention and alot of thninking and help from Colin.

> If i had more time i would make Hangman too.
> I did stick to the budget.
